# Newton Interpolation
A small web-app showcasing Newton's Interpolation Algorithm in a visually pleasing way.


### TLDR

You can check the project over at [codecrafted.net/newton](http://codecrafted.net/newton).


### What in the world is "Newton's interpolation algorithm"?

This is one of the many algorithms around to map a function through a set of points. Other well known algorithms are Lagrange's and more "basic" algorithms like cosine interpolation and cubic interpolation.


### Why did you make this?

I recently had to study a bunch of these algorithms so I figured, why not. The whole concept of being able to map a function through an arbitrary amount of points amazed me for some odd reason.

Then again, it is mathematics, so I completely understand if this is boring to you.


### Can I u- Sure go ahead.
